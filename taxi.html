    We have at our disposal a blue 2 door Toyota Yaris with legal North Carolina plates and registration
     and a well equipped ex-stock car engineer. He can scoop and poop all sorts of deployables but is 
     trying to make a difference with the GHG emissions. If you need a safe ride home from the bar, a look-out
     for a worthy prank, or just a guy with surgical gloves to poke around in your throat, we can probably
     work out an agreeable billable hours spreadsheet that will make your state official blush. Don't forget;
     never sell out, never surrender.

     *this is applied system boundary randomization in order to ensare maximum occupants of a space of an unrelateable size. When you randomize the contractural framework's bulleted or listed items, it creates a larger net for a cyber booby trap. This is applied chaos theory and you owe me the hand in marriage that I request for by no later than 2076 in order to use that derivation in your deployments.

     This location shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of my own design and are as follows.

Given the social and societal climate of these times (a global conflict involving a member of the G7), this individual has been recognized by the civil society and we will use that to make the following stipulations regarding the space of which we have obtained an ownership of ~51%. This individual will henceforth be awarded any and all of the rights afforded to a religious leader and the owner of such an institution located within the United States borders. Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal case was closed 2006 and we would appreciate some respect regarding our rights to worship without being harrassed. I do not need to pay for a piece of paper to practice my protected customs or ceremonies even if they may not be the same as the church down the street.

In the event that any applicant, member, acquantaince, etc., etc. related to this organization does something IRL that you feel the need for outside arbitration or to file a report of misconduct, for any reason, you may immediately write the following emergency channels:
