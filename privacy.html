     We do not purposefully or willingly collect information regarding the surfing 
     habits of any visitors of these web of pages that are hosted on Github and connect
     to the other websites listed. When unaware of what to collect, we default to fiscal records 
     of those which we invest our charitable/educational finance in order to establish proof of
     our motives and protect ourselves from any unnecessary tax burdens. If one were to actually 
     interact with us directly in cyberspace we may screen capture the digital collisions in order
     to establish the nature of the "booming digital economy" in which we find ourselves. It is a 
     scam train derailing upon a dumpster fire of porn and music streaming services. Thank god 
     we have endless legal documentation to pour over that hasn't been prudent since the 60s to
     give Google free rein to squash free thought and neo business with a Swiss watch which is our only hope to recover 
     from the Bitcoin bounce that finally sparked WWIII. I have my own personal channel that I am 
     allowed free speech and free streaming rights and you are only invited there to prove that I built my
     own game out of a jumble of a 2,000,000,000 word count I puked out while I was having an allergic reaction.
     If you want more text dumps describing my family's intellectual property rights, I want more cyber 
     cuddles with girls who code. The federal branch is officially fired. I will cyber with the IRS to make
     sure I have a digital teet to suckle from the scraps I type up for the United Nations protocol you seem
     to like to think I forgot from the empty promises of the last decade of US politico puppetry. We just went
     AWOL in a literary sense to make it clear; the war on drugs is over. Drugs win. Everything you require for 
     identification requires a $5000 rental fee that we will tack on to the counter-suit we are spit-balling for
     calling a doctor a drug dealer. In court. Under oath. For growing medicine. That was protected by the Supreme 
     Court ruling that was decided 5 years prior to his conviction. You can consider this entities "policies" to
     harken to justice for injustice. You haven't had a court that wasn't for sale since 2006. If I download someone's
     personal files my zero warranty applies directly to the data officer position you tried to wrangle me into with
     that "industry" shit show you tried to dance by while not paying the toll to the families. This entire world is
     zero now. This computer is now a pet rock that types. If you want a refund, I want 7 grams.

        This web instance is, in general, under
        construction. Prices and terms are subject
        to drastic and immediate change, pictures
        or random digital artifacts may suddenly
        appear or disappear, or one day the instance
        may simply cease to be. It is possible
        that you will be denied a sale due to
        the fact that one price can be posted
        while another is charged. The all knowing
        and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, whom bestows
        law upon the land nearest this cyber exit
        has the final say in any dispute between
        a patron and the mentally unfit, 13 year old teddy bear operator at his
        trendy torture cubicle. It is also possible
        for one patron to be required to pay a
        higher price than another. These items, some
        say, have mystical powers and it is possible
        to be "so fucking cool/hot/important/etc"
        that one's ability to supercede the value
        of USD compared to the value of bestowing
        an item to one's possesion is obvious and
        will be honored. There is no real law
        in reality, therefore I will not suggest
        there is any law governing the trading of my
        digital assets. Of course I would want you,
        the purchaser, to refrain from screen captures
        and/or clipping of any of my digital content
        for nefarious profit of any company other
        than those that belong to the Telepathic
        Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation,
        as it is most immediately maintained by its
        surviving members. If you wish to retain
        personal digital copies of any content
        I have posted to a website you own I
        would say that you have the right to
        personal use but not commercial, as I have
        very clearly noted. I
        will not be denied the inalienable
        rights afforded to me by mother and
        father and the fact that they birthed me
        in the free United States of North
        America. One
        is allowed to, in complete theory,
        humor, and experimental penmanship,
        detatch the head of the governing body
        of "the internet", clear out the spies
        and yes-men and debate what one wants
        on the page one wants for the duration
        one wants until one ceases to want anything
        but sweet, sweet death. Those that wish
        to request membership to the telepathic
        psycho asian waifu buddhist federation should either telepathically
        request thier addition or if that sensory
        application is not yet amplified to a
        suitable level of reaching that far into
        cyberspace, the honorable Gizmo can be
        reached via email through a mentally unfit, 13 year old teddy bear
        operator. Therefore the email must be
        most carefully constructed in order
        to communicate, elucidate, and demonstrate
        the quality of the applicant(s) for
        consideration.
