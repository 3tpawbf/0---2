        This web instance is, in general, under
        construction. Prices and terms are subject
        to drastic and immediate change, pictures
        or random digital artifacts may suddenly
        appear or disappear, or one day the instance
        may simply cease to be. It is possible
        that you will be denied a sale due to
        the fact that one price can be posted
        while another is charged. The all knowing
        and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, whom bestows
        law upon the land nearest this cyber exit
        has the final say in any dispute between
        a patron and the mentally unfit, 13 year old teddy bear operator at his
        trendy torture cubicle. It is also possible
        for one patron to be required to pay a
        higher price than another. These items, some
        say, have mystical powers and it is possible
        to be "so fucking cool/hot/important/etc"
        that one's ability to supercede the value
        of USD compared to the value of bestowing
        an item to one's possesion is obvious and
        will be honored. There is no real law
        in reality, therefore I will not suggest
        there is any law governing the trading of my
        digital assets. Of course I would want you,
        the purchaser, to refrain from screen captures
        and/or clipping of any of my digital content
        for nefarious profit of any company other
        than those that belong to the Telepathic
        Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation,
        as it is most immediately maintained by its
        surviving members. If you wish to retain
        personal digital copies of any content
        I have posted to a website you own I
        would say that you have the right to
        personal use but not commercial, as I have
        very clearly noted. I
        will not be denied the inalienable
        rights afforded to me by mother and
        father and the fact that they birthed me
        in the free United States of North
        America. One
        is allowed to, in complete theory,
        humor, and experimental penmanship,
        detatch the head of the governing body
        of "the internet", clear out the spies
        and yes-men and debate what one wants
        on the page one wants for the duration
        one wants until one ceases to want anything
        but sweet, sweet death. Those that wish
        to request membership to the telepathic
        psycho asian waifu buddhist federation should either telepathically
        request thier addition or if that sensory
        application is not yet amplified to a
        suitable level of reaching that far into
        cyberspace, the honorable Gizmo can be
        reached via email through a mentally unfit, 13 year old teddy bear
        operator. Therefore the email must be
        most carefully constructed in order
        to communicate, elucidate, and demonstrate
        the quality of the applicant(s) for
        consideration.
