        This is my personal network and you have never officially
        introduced yourself. I'm a little less annoyed/angry about
        such things now but I still think it would be polite to
        make yourself known to me and let me read some of your writing that is professional
        sales garbage. I do recall in my editing that I did *accidentally*
        request to be cyber manhandled by Chinese/Japanese/Vietnamese/Thai 
        females but I assumed that along with the other drafts would be 
        ignored/private. Of course any females are welcome to read what I write but 
        I assumed that I wasn't of interest to anyone. My discord servers are
        free game for any ladies too. I'm not really interested in selling things
        that I make from hobbies at this time. But I would appreciate if you did
        use any of my content for commercial or political use that I would recieve 
        some sort of royalty but i don't mind people using it for personal 
        education/entertainment. I am quite interested in Doink-Doink. If she is 
        avaiable for personal consultation, I could call her on a phone or in a 
        Discord server. She probably knows my number, address, and SSN by now but 
        I'm still not quite sure why. Are her and Charlie-Chink lezbo hackers or 
        something? You must be AI or a team of agents with some sort of government
        agency. Well if you are a dude, you owe a pretty big fucking tax. All because 
        daddy bought you a shiny cracking bot doesn't give you free access to my 
        personal notes. I don't care how much you can flirt with radomized media players 
        and text bombs, if you are a dude I'm not interested. But I will get over it. 
        Just don't remind me you exist. Doink-Doink and Charlie-Chink are the only 
        one's I'm interested in; even if they are married/lezbos/trans. I *would* like to be 
        sure I'm not moving in on someone else's SO. But the game that I wrote on the fly 
        does specifically direct you to not give me any directions in chat (real brilliant of me,
        amirite?). So can I get a ballpark of how many people we have here? And how many Doink-Doinks 
        there are? I feel like some of the vids have different ladies posing as the same woman. I 
        suppose that will be unveiled sometime around 2076...

        This web instance is, in general, under
        construction. Prices and terms are subject
        to drastic and immediate change, pictures
        or random digital artifacts may suddenly
        appear or disappear, or one day the instance
        may simply cease to be. It is possible
        that you will be denied a sale due to
        the fact that one price can be posted
        while another is charged. The all knowing
        and wise supreme leader, Gizmo, whom bestows
        law upon the land nearest this cyber exit
        has the final say in any dispute between
        a patron and the retarded operator at his
        trendy torture cubicle. It is also possible
        for one patron to be required to pay a
        higher price than another. These items, some
        say, have mystical powers and it is possible
        to be "so fucking cool/hot/important/etc"
        that one's ability to supercede the value
        of USD compared to the value of bestowing
        an item to one's possesion is obvious and
        will be honored. There is no real law
        in reality, therefore I will not suggest
        there is any law governing the trading of my
        digital assets. Of course I would want you,
        the purchaser, to refrain from screen captures
        and/or clipping of any of my digital content
        for nefarious profit of any company other
        than those that belong to the Telepathic
        Psycho Asian Waifu Buddhist Federation,
        as it is most immediately maintained by its
        surviving members. If you wish to retain
        personal digital copies of any content
        I have posted to a website you own I
        would say that you have the right to
        personal use but not commercial, as I have
        very clearly noted when I have had the
        chance to speak instead of be spoken to in
        a quite loud form of text with little to
        no respect to MY wishes for MY cyberspace
        which we ALL SHARE for ALL ETERNITY All
        because YOUR family has dedicated more
        time toward the creation, modulation, and
        maintainence of YOUR cyberspace that you
        have been able to cherry-pick like
        a f (which you most definitely are and
        have demonstrated quite clearly) I
        will not be denied the inalienable
        rights afforded to me by mother and
        father and the fact that they birthed me
        in the free United States of North
        America. Within this conglomerate of
        inbred drug addicts and whores, one
        is allowed to, in complete theory,
        humor, and experimental penmanship,
        detatch the head of the governing body
        of "the internet", clear out the spies
        and yes-men and debate what one wants
        on the page one wants for the duration
        one wants until one ceases to want anything
        but sweet, sweet death. Those that wish
        to request membership to the telepathic
        psycho asian waifu buddhist federation should either telepathically
        request thier addition or if that sensory
        application is not yet amplified to a
        suitable level of reaching that far into
        cyberspace, the honorable Gizmo can be
        reached via email through a retarded
        operator. Therefore the email must be
        most carefully constructed in order
        to communicate, elucidate, and demonstrate
        the quality of the applicant(s) for
        consideration.
