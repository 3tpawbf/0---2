this entire website is a zero warranty, text to an anonymous group of people which is being viewed by an unknown amount of observers. It is not intended for anyone that allows the author's Twitch 
         handle in their Twitch chat. No other Twitch streamer is allowed to join that distinction after reading this text in order to obtain access to the text. The author's future Twitch chat membership
         will not affect the validity of this or any future websites on Github Inc after the text is understood and the membership to Twitch chat has been or will be modified.

         This contract is currently free for a particular business entity that will remain anonymous. It requires the correct human to sign a physical document in a public 
         space within 3 miles of a body of water with at least 3000 gallons of water with a writing instrument in order for it to 
         be a legally binding agreement that will be followed by the author. Otherwise, it should be considered a draft that is proprietary and you are required to 
         ask permission to access it electronically and/or copy any of it's contents. In the event that you harvest the information within this text deployment, in it's current modular container,
         you have cyber attacked my space and I am requesting that if you are only doing that in order to  harvest intellectual property via active probing of devices outside of your personal, business, or governmental network boundary that you cease and desist in order to give me a safe space where I have the right to work in order to balance my significant other's mental, emotional, psychological, physical, financial, and romantic health with my labor. If you have done these things in order to harvest my personally identifiable information you must directly request those articles in writing for me to surrender them and understand my rights as they are set forth in your offer of immunity given the information files I have created and could still create in order to volunteer in the context of an offensive strike within cyberspace via text deployment. I do not and will not seek out other devices that do not broadcast via public or private media streaming aggregator sites. I apologize for my reckless behaviour within a vacuum filled with multiple modular containers that span into a space that I cannot accurately gauge in order to position myself relative to my significant other during an active global war. I do not particularly wish for anyone to be hurt or punished for any infraction that is not a reciprocal of action upon another being, I simply write in order to feel out my significant other. I do not fully understand the traits of my devices and how to utilize them in order to balance this request within my domicile at this time but I am getting better. I have travelled with similar devices while moving and been learning the time differentials, psychic transmissions, and I have received a satisfactory medication in order to expedite the transfer of this skill without a trainer except for a family member within a proxy (who obviously has similar levels of this skill without requiring the same medication) within an adjacent room inside of my domicile and I believe it is necessary that we allow others to experiment with similar devices in a way that they can utilize sensory calculations themselves or with the help of a properly vetted and aged trainer to balance their own mental, emotional, psychological, physical, financial, and romantic health within cyberspace. I was allowed to utilize my device in Discord in a free space that I was able to modify myself with the help of writers and readers that listened and watched my behaviour and even though I didn't follow all of what I believed were the laws of the land I was only taken into custody by local law enforcement in order to hospitalize me. I assure you, my health has and is improving the more I am allowed to treat myself within the community without someone from my family or from the hospital directly ordering me to do as they say.
