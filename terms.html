<h3>FEES AND PAYMENT</h3>
<hr style="width:75%;height:2.5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">
<br>
<br>
</center>
Some of The Ship is provided on a fee basis. You agree to pay KNIVES!!! the fees for each Ship you purchase or use in accordance with the pricing and payment 
terms presented to you for such Ship. You hereby authorize KNIVES!!! to charge your credit card or other payment method on a monthly, annual, or other agreed upon 
basis, as set forth in the pricing and payment terms presented to you for The Ship, in advance of providing The Ship. The Ship may be interrupted on accounts that 
are past due. Fees paid by you are non-refundable, except as provided in the rub or to the extent required by law. Accounts that are not collectable by KNIVES!!! 
may be turned over to an outside collection agency for collection. You may cancel your use of The Ship at any time as noted on our dashboard. You understand and 
agree that you will not receive a refund or credit of any pre-paid fees.
<br>
<br>
Subject to the rub, parts of The Ship is provided to you without charge, up to certain specified limits. Usage over these limits requires your purchase of 
additional resources or The Ship and KNIVES!!! may limit your access or usage until the required payment is made. You acknowledge that KNIVES!!! may prospectively 
change the specified rates and charges from time to time.
<br>
<br>
KNIVES!!! is not responsible for any additional bank fees, interest charges, finance charges, overdraft charges, or other fees resulting from charges billed by 
KNIVES!!!. Currency exchange settlements will be based on agreements between you and the provider of your credit card.
<br>
<br>
You agree to pay any and all fees associated with the currency exchange of your denomination of payment to legal USD for KNIVES'!!! Ship and it's partners', 
subsidiaries', superiors', dependents', heads of state's, local syndicate capos', next of kin's, romantic interests', secrataries', co-workers', and online forum 
buddies' Ships as that payment trickles down. To clarify, after paymemnt is recieved by KNIVES!!!, the resultant oiling of the machine of production must be 
completed as well so there may be a fee associated with the conversion of your denomination to real world environments, virtual environments, and imaginary 
environments. For instance, adult web models deal in tokens. These are worthless dog shit. You will pay real money or prepare yourself to be debated upon on the 
value of your currency; not backroom hacks of legal currency exchanges or credit card agreements where you flip the agreement to your side. This entity accepts 
LEGAL TENDER and SENSIBLE TRADE AGREEMENTS. For further clarification of this topic, refer to the color coded portion of the policy section. This is a topic that 
can be debated to naseum, though I am not interested in hearing your psychotic business model arguments for cryptocurrency, online tokens or credit card 
agreements unless you are willing to negotiate YOUR terms. You have seen what I am capable of writing ten times over by now. You don't write. You copy and paste. 
Not to say that coders don't write. Coding is an incredibly complex past time but so is life. You choose to read. Grow some skin.

<h3>GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION, AND VENUE</h3>
<hr style="width:75%;height:2.5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">
<br>
<br>
</center>
The rub shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods. BOMBS!!! 
hereby consents to the jurisdiction of, and laying of venue in, such court(s) and waives any objection thereto.
<br>
<br>
With regards to this stipulation, given the social and societal climate of these times (a global conflict involving a member of the G7), this individual has been 
awarded the irrevocable distinction of the leader of our own Shore and we will use that to make the following demands of the impotent federal branch. This 
individual will henceforth be awarded any and all of the rights afforded to a religious leader and the owner of such an institution located within the United 
States borders. Acting in the best interest of the community, we demand that in accordance with Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal, that 
any and all United States governmental agencies are ordered to cease and desist any and all investigations related to the community's NON-VIOLENT use of 
controlled substances or they should incur a fine greater than or equal to the back tax of the illegal financial kneecapping of any and all of the estates 
wrongfully prosecuted during the "War on Drugs" after the Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal case was closed (arguable 1993) (to clarify: 
EVERY CITIZEN OF THE US HAS RELIGIOUS FREEDOM. "The Man" wrongfully redistributed estates via a flawed legal framework in some cases. If religious institutions 
have the rights afforded by Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal because of their rights to excercise their religious beliefs then by logic 
do not all citizens have the rights to religious freedom? To digest any substance their religious beliefs dictate are necessary for them to "converse with God", 
"execute a religious ceremony", etc, etc, as was ruled in Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal? I do regularly speak with God while I 
digest my current diet, which I am allergic to). All files, reports, testimonies, etc., etc., of NON-VIOLENT controlled substance cases shall hereby be 
systematically destroyed in accordance with the current DOD security standards of cryptography. All government employees that have worked on or are currently 
working on (including NARCO! and any and all undercover operations funded by the United States government!) such projects are hereby ordered to report to 
debriefing within their project umbrellas, frameworks, and chain of command. They are to be allowed for their projects to naturally extinguish in the fashion that 
the chaotic system dictates or be immediately extradited to a safe location if the operational framework dictates such. Furthermore, this facility, and any 
following facilities the current leader of KNIVES!!! owns and controls, shall be considered exempt from federal extradition and controlled substance laws as per 
their religious beliefs. Any human that is granted a stay within a KNIVES!!! controlled facility for more than three (3) years will be granted American 
citizenship via spirital osmosis and the leader's proprietary training program. This will serve as a legally binding endeavor that awards irrevocable and 
non-transferable United States citizenship to the parties that embark upon and complete that stay and the appropriate documentation is to be supplied to the human 
upon completion of this extracurricular activity. In accordance with the ruling of Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficiente Uniao Do Vegetal, any member of this 
organization will be permitted to transport any and all schedule distinctions of the federal controlled substances stipulations for the safe procurement, 
handling, and destruction of those substances within the facility's borders of any facility of which the acting leader owns and controls. Any paraphenalia related 
to the safe destruction of any controlled substances will be exempt from local ordinances regardless of resin or residual materials that remain after destruction.
These substances and the related paraphenalia WILL NOT be permitted to be exchanged for monetary gain after procurement. In the event that a member of KNIVES!!! 
exchanges a controlled substance or the destructive paraphenalia for monetary compensation they will be subject to the full penalty of the federal statutes 
regarding that exchange. The market has already determined the entities that are well equipped enough for this distinction through rigorous legal and physical 
gymnastics and will not be further tested by this acting housing authority at this time. These entities have developed thier own frameworks and coexist with the 
local economy within their own proprietary umbreallas that are outside of the scope of this entity's focus. These frameworks should be respected but this writer 
has no knowledge of their interworkings and has zero (0) interest in investigating, reporting on, researching, learning, etc., etc., how they operate legally 
within the United States borders. This order is based on an independent, clandestine study that has been conducted by a sole operator for 15 years.

In the event that any applicant, member, acquantaince, etc., etc. related to this organization does something IRL that you feel the need for outside arbitration 
or to file a report of misconduct, for any reason, you may immediately call or write the following emergency channels:

marblegitcounter@proton.me (the current acting leader and sole member)

intentions as reflected in the provision, and the other provisions of the rub remain in full force and effect.
