think I signed up for this that no, this was foisted upon me by my birth, upbringing, and the state

          03/24/2024 UPDATE
          <hr style="width:75%;height:5px;border-width:0;color:white;background-color:white">
          For legal issues and bureaucratic completeness "this" project, any umbrellas, and 
          any future postulations should be referred to as "cLuStErFLuX LLC" and the sole member
          and acting CEO et al is Andrew Branch. We have no digital partnerships at this time.
          The scope of this undertaking is massive but this is the gist of what I believe will be 
          possible within my lifetime and has already come to fruition with regards to my situations.
          The facility we control %51 of at this time is to be defined as such: The master bedroom
          is a Buddhist Monestary equipped with what can be considered cyber weaponry, facility survellience
          equipment, and clinical stenography device that serves as a makeshift medical device (it supplies
          mental health therapy regiments, connection to the outside world, and videographic machinery to 
          monitor a patient). While we study the Tao here, we concurrently care for our elderly father who 
          suffers from depression and slight dementia. We help in collecting and unloading food stuffs, take 
          out the trash, manage the grounds, and periodically check his vitals on a randomization schedule. I 
          concurrently work as a zeroth responder within the community and have become a subordinate business
          partner with a retired Marine from my local employment opportunities research. We are stocked with
          medical supplies, a fire extinguisher, various food stuffs, and an independent fiscal branch within a 
          mentally encrypted mobility SOW that I deployed given I have a right to work and a right to live. We 
          have our own medical team that is allowed access to the facility on a scheduling basis with the CEO
          who has admitted difficulty with the discontinuities between law of the land and what they are told is true.
          It is quite possible that the previous diagnosis by outside doctors could be unreasonable and that the 
          patient has acertained the main factors that led to the psychotic breaks they experienced. In order to
          actually be brought up to speed on the case, one would require a deposition-like experience with the patient
          and most of the medical team we currently employ have conceeded most of the points the patient adamantly makes
          when they are frustrated with the discontinuities observed within the community. Any North American state employees
          or United States federal employees with access to a firearm within their organizational boundary that are 
          privy to this text deployment are hereby ordered to either retire from active survellience of this individual 
          or surrender all findings of their investigation to a neutral arbiter within a United Nations arbitration 
          framework in order to comply with my current experimental deployment of a military protocol deployment that 
          has stemmed from my legal discovery with regards to the IPCC reporting protocol. Blatant ignorance of international 
          law and rampant cronyism is what forced my hand in requiring my arguments to be heard in a public discorse 
          environment in order to protect my right to work and my right to live. I am currently developing a counter-suit
          to be heard by an arbiter within the United Nations framework for theft of capital goods via perjury by North Carolina
          state law enforcement's legal teams in 2011 against my father, Andrew Jackson Branch II. We also have multiple active 
          black market methamphetamine labs within the main transportation loop of my city and they are being harbored by local
          closed door easement arrangements. The United States government is trying to fiscally dominate the medical 
          arena in order to distribute poorly tested medications via the Medicaid program while concurrently feeding 
          children methamphetamine salts by prescribing Adderall perscriptions. I do not consent to being forcibly medicated
          for attempting to report drug trafficking patterns while I attempted to work within my city's industrial workplace.
          My diagnosis as a schizo-effective bipolar male is the exercise of medical incompetence by a doctor of psychiatry
          while refusing to field legal arguments of a slandered scientist. I studied engineering and sustainability. I was
          thrown to the wolves by way of the Food and Beverage industry where any report regarding drug trafficking out of the
          back door of a business resulted in an immediate firing. I never had a safe place to report the fact that the black
          drug markets are NEVER going to be rooted out of our communities via a political declaration of war on our own citizens
          within North America. You are not allowed to abduct and drug people all because you have a medical license. This
          property has been socially and economically manipulated by the community in order to wash money, not in order to
          medically benefit a patient that only ever suffered from non-violent, recreational drug use. The Supreme Court unanimously
          ruled that all tribal religious organizations are allowed to import any controlled substance, regardless of its 
          scheduling, in order to practice religious ceremony within a church. I have managed this facility as a group home
          for 15 years of ownerships and now that I own more than %51 of the facility I have ordained it a Buddhist Monastery
          by the rights of my Navajo blood. I do not need to pay another tax to another government agency to read another
          stream of conciousness text deployment by a non-violent man. I have never broken a law. And I have been abducted
          7 times at least to be force fed shit drugs and brainwashed into believing I've done something wrong. If I ever wronged
          in my life, it was when I trusted people with enough money to own a facility other than their home. United States business
          is the reason black market drugs are available on every corner.

    These are religious institutions that engage in research and development topics
    that were created for a United States' branch of the telepathic psycho asian waifu
    buddhist federation. All data, information, and creations should
    be considered as is and hold no warranty. Any online
    proceeds, donations, or investments should go towards
    the financial links associated with these pages or the
    financial branches of the associated consultants of the federation.
    These individual branches will invest capital on the tools
    of their respective trades, food, fuel, medical provisions, and housing while they
    work to on virtual and real world community building
    through experimental writing/research/development of
    content creation and real world deployments for the less fortunate, and educational
    content for other online viewers,
    creators, mentors, and consultants. We want to foster
    a habit of consensual and competent content creation
    that if anything improves the human condition through
    humor, mutual understanding, and love.
    All donations are voluntary and will not be refunded
    once they clear with the respective company's financial
    branch. These LLCs do not transfer any good or service
    in response to any investment to any branch of the
    federation, no matter how large. They are independent
    shell entities that create content and analysis at the sole operator's
    leisure and they do not align with any group, gang, or
    party other than the federation they have created through
    rigorous interviews and study that should be considered
    proprietary and as valuable as their other intellectual
    assets. If you have any questions or comments about
    WaifuWorks LLC, Clusterflux LLC, TPAWBF(._.), their artistic, educational, or religious
    competence to practice in this sphere, or their ability
    to work within the IRL community towards common goals
    that improve the human condition without unnecessary
    state mandated oversight, please contact this instance
