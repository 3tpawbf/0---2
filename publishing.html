        The best I could do with the bullshit sandwich of life. Multi billion dollar companies dump mega tons of carbon into the atmosphere while they rake in 
        billions in profits for building planned obsolescence into non-renewable "toys" that lead the proletariat to believe they have a chance to make a dent in 
        the ruling classes' stranglehold on the money, the drugs, and the opposite sex that is worth one's time and attention. We are all trapped in an endless 
        loop inside a pressure cooker that will eventually be hit by an asteroid if we are lucky. It's only going to get hotter, scarier, and less sensible the 
        more we hump the legs of the one's that legally rape because they have the money to make the laws. If you want to spend your money on something important, 
        help these kids: <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/10/29/us/juvenile-detention-abuses-louisiana.html">Lousiana Juvenile Torture, the New

        I could write a website an hour and host them on an independent VPN array from my facility while cooking methamphetamines in the woods that I feed to 
        prostitutes that I pimp to the local community. Instead I write. Only God knows why. You are all mentally handicapped gamers that need your parents to pay 
        your X-box accounts. The "adults in charge" drag their feet like club footed mongoloids in public spaces to make a scene and maintain the past biases and 
        backwards thinking about race, religion, sex, gender, drugs, relationships, and mental health. I *will* write what I want, when I want, at the volume I 
        wish, and I will not let your little python bugs stop me from making you all look like idiots 
        
        Rmbr kids. Treat your profsional career like a Desert Eagle pistol. Point that sucker straight toward the ground and unload it repeatedly until your 
        demands of the prison state are respected. Squander the precious resource that is your training by abusing drugs and jacking off.
